# Crop Yield Prediction

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict crop yields based on environmental, soil, and agricultural data. Accurate crop yield predictions are essential for optimizing agricultural resources, ensuring food security, and assisting farmers and policymakers in making data-driven decisions. Using machine learning techniques, this model analyzes patterns and relationships between various factors to forecast yield for specific crops.

## Dataset
The dataset includes essential features that influence crop growth and productivity:

Environmental Data: Includes historical temperature, rainfall, humidity, and sunlight levels, which directly impact crop growth.
Soil Characteristics: Information on soil pH, soil type, and nutrient levels (e.g., nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium) helps gauge the soil's suitability for crop cultivation.
Agricultural Practices: Details on irrigation frequency, types and quantities of fertilizers, and pesticide use.
Historical Crop Yields: Previous yields serve as a benchmark for predicting future crop productivity.
Geospatial Data: Regional information, including location coordinates and elevation, provides localized context for environmental and soil conditions.

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to predict crop yields accurately by training and testing various machine learning models. This enables agricultural stakeholders to anticipate productivity levels and optimize their agricultural strategies based on reliable predictions.

## Key Technologies
Programming Language: Python
Machine Learning Libraries: scikit-learn, pandas, numpy
Visualization: matplotlib, seaborn
Modeling Approaches: Regression models, Neural Networks, and Ensemble methods

## How to Use
Data Preprocessing: Load the dataset and preprocess the data by handling missing values, scaling features, and encoding categorical variables.
Model Training: Train machine learning models using the prepared dataset.
Evaluation: Evaluate models based on accuracy, mean squared error, and other metrics to select the best-performing model.
Prediction: Use the trained model to predict crop yield for new data inputs.
